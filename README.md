## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Inline CSS


### What I learned

I have gained a deeper understanding of media queries and how they can be used to create responsive web designs

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue refining my skills in CSS layout techniques, particularly with Flexbox and Grid. I aim to explore more advanced concepts such as CSS animations and transitions to enhance user interactivity. Additionally, I would like to improve my proficiency in JavaScript to implement dynamic features in my projects. This will help me create more engaging and interactive user experiences as I progress in my front-end development journey.
